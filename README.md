Build a recipe website to practice basic HTML skills
# After-thoughts
I finally finished this after 2.5 hours. I tried to extend the project by adding things not taught
in the previous lessons of TOP. However, I find it hard since most of the things I wanted to add (e.g., making the numbers in OL bold, putting a menu option, etc.) involve CSS. 
Therefore the only things I added were:
1. Fixed the image size by using width attribute
2. Used the description list elements (dd, dt, dl) in lumpia.html
3. used some inline text semantics other than strong,em elements,

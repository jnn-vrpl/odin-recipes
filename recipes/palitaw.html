        <p>This sticky, chewy dessert is very easy to make and can also be served as a snack.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour (malagkit)</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
                <li>4 ounces grated coconut</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the rice flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and the water together in a bowl into a soft dough; set aside.</li>
                <li>Stir 1/2 cup sugar and sesame seeds together in a small bowl.
                     Toss the coconut with the salt together in a separate bowl.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Take a portion of the soft dough and roll it into a ball between the palms of your hands. Pull lengthwise and shape into a tongue. 
                    Drop into the boiling water. The cake is ready when it floats. Scoop it out with a strainer and roll it in the sugar and sesame seed mixture.
                     Place it on a serving platter. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Top the cakes with coconut and serve warm.</li>
